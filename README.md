# MSH_Frankia
This repo contains data and R scripts for the manuscript <b><i>Frankia</i> diversity in sympatrically-occurring red alder (<i>Alnus rubra</i>) and Sitka alder (<i>Alnus viridis</i>)</b>, which is currently being submitted to the journal <i>Trees</i>.

Files with .shared filetypes contain OTU tables output from mothur.

The OTU of each sample is contained in OTU_listfile.csv.

For GPS information, please see gps_plots.csv.
